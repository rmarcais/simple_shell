.SH NAME

simple_shell \- command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fB ./hsh is the executable

.SH DESCRIPTION

The hsh simple_shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems.
The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.


.SH LEXICAL STRUCTURE

The shell reads input in terms of lines from a file and breaks it up into words at white spaces, and at certain sequences of characters that are special to the shell calls "operators".

.SH DEFINITION

The shell interprets the words it reads according to a language, the specification of which is outside the scope of this man page. Essentially though, a line is read and if the first word of the line is not a reserved word, then the shell has recognized a simple command.

There are three types of  commands: shell functions, builtins commands, and normal programs.

.SS SHELL FUNCTIONS

When a shell function is executed, all of the shell positional parameters are set to the arguments of the shell function.

.SS BUILTINS COMMANDS

Shell builtins are executed internally to the shell, without spawning a new process.

This section lists the builtins commands which are builtin because they
need to perform some operation that can't be performed by a separate
process.

Builtins
echo | Print the arguments on the standard ouput
pwd | display the path of the current directory
exit or [Ctrl + d] | this command will exit the shell
cd + [directoryname] | will bring you to the directory expected
env | This function will list all the environ
printev | This function will list all the environ

.SS NORMAL PROGRAMS

If the command name doesn't match a function or builtin, the command is searched for as a normal program in the file system. When a normal program is executed, the shell runs the program, passing the arguments and the environment to the program.

\fBEXAMPLE :\fP

 1- Function "ls -l"

The ls -l function is executed in the shell and lists all the file of the current directory in a long format. "-l" is an option of the "ls" command and for more information about this function input "man ls" in your shell.

 2- When Ctrl + c is type on the keyboard, it doesn't exit and display the ^c with return to the line.

 3- PWD allows to obtain the path of the current directory.

.SH OPTIONS

There can be some options like for the function ls. Like ls -l which will list file from the directory in long format.

.SH RETURN VALUE

If the command is welled execute, the list will appear. If it fail, an error message will be displayed.
